### Questions

### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

I enjoy both fiction and nonfiction. Recently, I have leaned in to creative non-fiction wanting to adapt my novel into a screenplay. I have a soft spot for poetry and am inspired by spoken word.

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?


I use Word. I sit at my desk when I need to read and concentrate. I sit on the couch in front of the TV when I need noise to relax my mind and become creative. 
I use my notes on my android in bed when I feel like writing or taking extended notes. I use voice memo or notes when I am in the shower. 
I listen to music to find inspiration and I look up the thesaurus alot. I ask google questions on how to spell words. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrains the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

I can type from memory and therefore able to focus on the words on screen. I like to feel confident as I type. When I brainstorm I like to use paper and pen. 
I use Final Draft for scripts.

### What aspects of the remix are the same?
The pace of the movement remains the same. 

### What aspects of the remix are different?
Background and text are in yellow and red instead of TG green & pale pink text. 
In TG, each line host a different number of words creating the visual of a poem on page. 
MS piece speaks on political issue whereas TG words are visually appealing. 

### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
I persoanlly found this piece to be more interesting to read due to a brighter colour on the page, along with a 4 - 6 words per line, creating more structure as prose instead of poetry.
